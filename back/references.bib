The properties of WDM-MDM links with three wavelengths and two optical modes are numerically studied by using 3-D beam propagation method. In the first design, the wavelength combiner is also an MMI coupler type. The insertion loss of the design is around 6 dB because of the inherent loss of the MMI combiner. The size of the main passive optical parts (mode DE/MUXs and wavelength combiner) of the design is only 10.4 × 114.2 μm2, making the design promising for future compact and high-capacity optical interconnection applications. In another design, arrayed waveguide gratings are used for wavelength multiplexing, leading to a lower insertion loss of the optical connections. For both designs, the mode crosstalk between the two different modes for the same wavelength are below -22 dB.},

Further optimization is achieved by secondary adjustment of the blaze angle of grating facets and the position of output waveguides according to the simulated field distribution. The device has four channels with channel spacing of 20 nm and a small footprint of only 140×100 µm2. The simulated insertion loss for all channels is lower than 2 dB with insertion loss uniformity of below 1dB, and the crosstalk is better than 40 dB.}

The 1 × 4 (de-)multiplexers are designed for a channel separation of 25 nm and operate within 990$-$1065 nm for bottom emitting vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL)-based optical links. For Si3N4 Gaussian AWGs, we demonstrate crosstalk \&lt;$-$35 dB at the peak transmission band with insertion loss \&lt;0.5 dB. Measurements were performed over many dies, and pass-band standard deviations for channel 1$-$4 are 0.49, 0.66, 0.42, and 0.37 nm, respectively. Results for flat-top AWGs indicate crosstalk \&lt;$-$20 dB, with insertion loss \&lt;3 dB for the best devices. Flat-top cascaded 2nd order and 3rd order MZI lattice filters show a minimum of crosstalk \&lt;$-$15 dB and \&lt;$-$20 dB, respectively. The pass-band temperature shift was determined to be 14.5 pm/\textdegreeC, which is lower than reported values for silicon. The device footprint of the Gaussian and flat-top AWGs are both $\sim$670 × 200 $\mu$m. The device footprint of the flat-top cascaded 2nd order and 3rd order lattice filters are 1160 × 470 $\mu$m and 1570 × 470 $\mu$m, respectively. We believe the Si3N4 platform has potential for its use in CWDM and possibly DWDM transceiver/optical-modules for data/computer communication in high temperature environments up to 80 \textdegreeC.},

    The most commonly studied resonators are ring/racetrack resonators. We have fabricated these and other resonators including
    disk resonators, waveguide-grating resonators, ring resonator reflectors, contra-directional grating-coupler ring
    resonators, and racetrack-based multiplexer/demultiplexers.
    While numerous resonators have been demonstrated for sensing purposes, it remains unclear as to which structures
    provide the highest sensitivity and best limit of detection; for example, disc resonators and slot-waveguide-based ring
    resonators have been conjectured to provide an improved limit of detection. Here, we compare various resonators in
    terms of sensor metrics for label-free bio-sensing in a micro-fluidic environment. We have integrated resonator arrays with
    PDMS micro-fluidics for real-time detection of biomolecules in experiments such as antigen-antibody binding reaction
    experiments using Human Factor IX proteins. Numerous resonators are fabricated on the same wafer and experimentally
    compared. We identify that, while evanescent-field sensors all operate on the principle that the analyte's refractive index
    shifts the resonant frequency, there are important differences between implementations that lie in the relationship between
    the optical field overlap with the analyte and the relative contributions of the various loss mechanisms.
    The chips were fabricated in the context of the CMC-UBC Silicon Nanophotonics Fabrication course and workshop.

The mode demultiplexer has a 2.3 $\mu$m-wide multimode bus waveguide, which supports six mode-channels of TE polarization and four mode-channels of TM polarization. These ten mode-channels are (de)multiplexed with five cascaded dual-core adiabatic tapers based on SOI nanowires. The widths for these dual-cores are chosen optimally according to the dispersion curves of the dual-core SOI nanowire, so that the desired highest-order modes of TE- and TM-polarizations are extracted simultaneously. These two extracted mode-channels are coupled very efficiently to the fundamental modes of TE- and TM-polarizations (TE0 and TM0) in the narrow waveguide, respectively, which are then separated by using a polarization beam splitter based on bent directional couplers. A chip consisting of a pair of 10-channel mode (de)multiplexers is fabricated and then tested with data transmission of 30Gbps/channel. The measurement results show that all TM- and TE mode-channels have low crosstalks ($-$15$\sim$$-$25 dB) and low excess losses (0.2$\sim$1.8 dB) over a broad wavelength band of $\sim$90 nm, which makes it WDM (wavelength-division-multiplexing)-compatible and thus suitable for high capacity on-chip optical interconnects.},

    igabstract = {Twenty-first century opportunities for GSI will be governed in part by a hierarchy of physical limits on interconnects whose levels are codified as fundamental, material, device, circuit, and system. Fundamental limits are derived from the basic axioms of electromagnetic, communication, and thermodynamic theories, which immutably restrict interconnect performance, energy dissipation, and noise reduction. At the material level, the conductor resistivity increases substantially in sub-50-nm technology due to scattering mechanisms that are controlled by quantum mechanical phenomena and structural/morphological effects. At the device and circuit level, interconnect scaling significantly increases interconnect crosstalk and latency. Reverse scaling of global interconnects causes inductance to influence on-chip interconnect transients such that even with ideal return paths, mutual inductance increases crosstalk by up to 60\% over that predicted by conventional RC models. At the system level, the number of metal levels explodes for highly connected 2-D logic megacells that double in size every two years such that by 2014 the number is significantly larger than ITRS projections. This result emphasizes that changes in design, technology, and architecture are needed to cope with the onslaught of wiring demands. One potential solution is 3-D integration of transistors, which is expected to significantly improve interconnect performance. Increasing the number of active layers, including the use of separate layers for repeaters, and optimizing the wiring network, yields an improvement in interconnect performance of up to 145\% at the 50-nm node.},

    ignoreabstract = {Coherent terahertz (THz) wireless communication using silicon photonics technology provides critical solutions for achieving high-capacity wireless transmission beyond 5G and 6G networks and seamless connectivity with fiber-based backbone networks. However, high-quality THz signal generation and noise-robust signal detection remain challenging owing to the presence of inter-channel crosstalk and additive noise in THz wireless environments. Here, we report coherent THz wireless communication using a silicon photonic integrated circuit that includes a dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and advanced digital signal processing (DSP). The structure and fabrication of the dual-parallel MZM-based silicon photonic integrated circuit are systematically optimized using the figure of merit (FOM) method to improve the modulation efficiency while reducing the overall optical loss. The advanced DSP compensates for in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance as well as phase noise by orthogonally decoupling the IQ components in the frequency domain after adaptive signal equalization and carrier phase estimation. The experimental results show a reduction in phase noise that induces degradation of transmission performance, successfully demonstrating error-free 1-m THz wireless transmission with bit-error rates of 10\&\#x2212;6 or less at a data rate of 50 Gbps.},

Although add/drop filters based on ring resonators and waveguide Bragg gratings are well developed, long period waveguide grating (LPWG) based add/drop filters have little been investigated so far. In this article, we propose an apodized LPWG assisted co-directional coupler for narrow band add/drop filtering by combining silicon (Si) waveguide with titanium dioxide (TiO2) waveguide geometry. The proposed structure has been analyzed by combining the finite element method (FEM) and transfer matrix method (TMM), showing a good side lobe suppression ratio (SLSR) equal to 25.7 dB and an insertion loss of 0.6 dB. Owing to the high group index difference of Si and TiO2 waveguides, a narrow band response of 1.4 nm has been achieved with 800{\textmu}m long LPWG. The opposite thermo-optic coefficients of Si and TiO2 ensures a good thermal tunability of the central wavelength. Considering a thin metallic heater of titanium nitride (TiN) the thermal tuning efficiency is found to be 0.07 nm/mW. Further, two LPWGs have been cascaded to realize a tunable dual channel filter with a minimum channel spacing of 185 GHz and a channel crosstalk better than 20 dB, showing its potential application towards dense wavelength division multiplexing.},

The SWG waveguide is designed to support Bloch mode for TM polarization so that the incident TM-polarized light goes through the SWG waveguide with very low excess loss. On the other hand, for TE polarization, the SWG waveguide works as a Bragg reflector, and consequently the incident TE-polarized light is reflected.

The (1+1) Evolution Strategy was applied to an eight-channel coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM) AWG as the optimization tool. For obtaining a broadened spectrum, we use a MMI coupler and the variation in optical path difference at each array waveguide changes the shape of the transfer function to obtain the optimal spectrum shape.},

The structure with an ultra-thin core layer helps to reduce the scattering due to the sidewall roughness and consequently shows very low loss of about 0.4~0.8dB/m. When using this type of optical waveguide for an AWG (de)multiplexer, there is no problem associated with gap refill using the upper-cladding material even when choosing a small (e.g., 1.0 $\mu$m) gap between adjacent arrayed waveguides, which helps to reduce the transition loss between the FPR (free-propagation region) and the arrayed waveguides. Therefore, the demonstrated AWG (de)multiplexer based on the present Si3N4 buried optical waveguides has a low on-chip loss. The fabricated AWG (de)multiplexer is characterized in two wavelength ranges around 1310nm and 1550nm, respectively. It shows that the crosstalk from adjacent and non-adjacent channels are about --30dB, and --40dB, respectively, at the wavelength range of 1310nm. The Si3N4 AWG (de)multiplexer has a temperature dependence of about 0.011nm/{\textdegree}C, which is close to that of a pure SiO2 AWG device.},

    ignoreabstract = {Bragg-grating based cavities and coupler designs present opportunities for flexible allocation of bandwidth and spectrum in silicon photonic devices. Integrated silicon photonic devices are moving toward mainstream, mass adoption, leading to the need for compact Bragg grating based designs. In this work we present a design and experimental validation of a cascaded contra-directional Bragg-grating coupler with a measured main lobe to side-lobe contrast of 12.93\&\#x2005;dB. This level of performance is achieved in a more compact size as compared to conventional apodized gratings, and a similar design philosophy can be used to improve side-lobe reduction in grating-based mirror design for on-chip lasers and other cavity-based designs as well.},

The MZM is in a push-pull configuration that is constructed using an ITO/graphene-based silicon waveguide. A novel idea for engineering of the plasma dispersion effect in an ITO/graphene-based waveguide is proposed so that the modulation characteristics of the MZM are highly improved. Plasma dispersion effects of ITO and graphene layers are tailored in such a way that a large difference between real parts of guided mode effective index of the two arms is achieved while their corresponding imaginary parts are equal. As a result, a very low $${{\mathrm {V}}}_{\pi }L_{\pi }$$of $$10 \, \hbox {V} \upmu \hbox {m}$$is achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the lowest $${{\mathrm {V}}}_{\pi }L_{\pi }$$reported for an electro-optic modulator. In addition, the proposed modulator exhibits a very high extinction ratio of more than 30 dB, low insertion loss of 2.8 dB and energy consumption of as low as 10 fJ/bit, which are all promising for optical communication and processing systems.},

   ignoreabstract = {A high-efficiency ultra-broadband multi-tip edge coupler based on a silicon-on-insulator platform for direct coupling with the elliptic beam of a distributed feedback laser was developed. The device is composed of a multi-tip section and a combiner section with extra offset regions to reduce the mode mismatch caused by the structural discontinuity which results from a limitation of the fabrication process that creates an inevitable gap width at the junction between the two sections. The widths and the spacing of the tips for the multi-tip section and the extra offset region for the combiner section are fine-tuned by using the particle swarm optimization method to reduce the mode mismatch. A high overall coupling efficiency up to 90.68\% (0.4249 dB) at 1550 nm can be achieved for the optimized 90-$\mu$m-long four-tip edge coupler. The device can be operated over a broad spectral range of 1260-1675 nm with less than 1 dB extra loss. With its high-efficiency ultra-broadband operation and small device footprint, the proposed device is promising for laser-to-chip edge coupling in silicon photonics.},

    igabstract = {A novel silicon-on-insulator (SOI) polarization splitter-rotator is proposed based on mode-evolution tapers and a mode-sorting asymmetric Y-junction. The tapers are designed to adiabatically convert the input TM0 mode into the TE1 mode, which will evolve into the TE0 mode in the wide output arm while the input TE0 mode excites the TE0 mode in the narrow arm. The numerical simulation results show that the mode conversion efficiency increases with the lengths of the tapers and the Y-junction for the output waveguide widths in a large range. This proposed device has \&lt; 0.4 dB insertion loss with \&gt; 12 dB extinction ratio in an ultra-broad wavelength range from 1350 nm to 1750 nm. With such a broad operating bandwidth, this device offers potential applications for polarization diversity operating across every communication bands. Fabrication tolerance analysis is also performed in terms of the device width variation, the slab height variation and the variation of the upper-cladding refractive index.},

   ignoreabstract = {An adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) that features better search efficiency than classical particle swarm optimization (PSO) is presented. More importantly, it can perform a global search over the entire search space with faster convergence speed. The APSO consists of two main steps. First, by evaluating the population distribution and particle fitness, a real-time evolutionary state estimation procedure is performed to identify one of the following four defined evolutionary states, including exploration, exploitation, convergence, and jumping out in each generation. It enables the automatic control of inertia weight, acceleration coefficients, and other algorithmic parameters at run time to improve the search efficiency and convergence speed. Then, an elitist learning strategy is performed when the evolutionary state is classified as convergence state. The strategy will act on the globally best particle to jump out of the likely local optima. The APSO has comprehensively been evaluated on 12 unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. The effects of parameter adaptation and elitist learning will be studied. Results show that APSO substantially enhances the performance of the PSO paradigm in terms of convergence speed, global optimality, solution accuracy, and algorithm reliability. As APSO introduces two new parameters to the PSO paradigm only, it does not introduce an additional design or implementation complexity.},

The (N + 1) × (N + 1) AWG works at a bidirectional way to provide two groups of N × 1 wavelength multiplexing with each group having a channel spacing of 2×Δλ, and the central wavelengths of all input channels in one group have a wavelength shift of Δλ with respect to those in the other group. The double channel spacing results in a significant decrease on the footprint of the (N + 1) × (N + 1) AWG-based multiplexer compared with a conventional 2N × 1 AWG multiplexer with the same wavelength spacing Δλ. Due to the fact that a single mode fiber is insensitive to the polarization of input light, if we consider short reach datacom applications such as 100/400 GbE, the two separate multiplexing outputs of the (N + 1) × (N + 1) AWG can be combined as one output with one half wavelengths working at TE polarization and the other at TM polarization by employing a low loss and broadband PCR. In the experiment, we demonstrate a 16 × 200 GHz multiplexer based on a 9 × 9 AWG. The experimental results show that the on-chip loss of the fabricated multiplexer is 2.7 dB and the loss uniformity is 0.5 dB. The 1-dB and 3-dB bandwidths are \&gt;0.56 nm (i.e., 35\% of the wavelength spacing) and \&gt;1.1 nm (i.e., 69\% of the wavelength spacing), respectively. They can also be further increased by decreasing the gap between adjacent input waveguides at the interfaces of star couplers of the designed AWG without inducing an excess loss. The proposed multiplexer has great potential for application to future super large capacity (&gt; Tb/s) data transmission systems.},

    igabstract = {The transparent window in optical fiber at 2-μm waveband enables a huge potential for fiber optical communications. Intensive efforts have been devoted to pursuit of photonic devices in this new band. The arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) is one of the key components for various functionalities like wavelength multiplexer, optical filter, spectrometer and so forth. However, the integrated and wavelength tunable AWG has not been realized in the 2-μm wavelength range yet. Here, we demonstrate an 8-channel thermo-optic tunable AWG at 2 μm via silicon photonic multi-project wafer shuttle run. The device is fully compatible with standard foundry fabrication process without customization. The TiN heater is designed for uniform waveguide heating and wavelength detuning. Experiments show that the fabricated AWG has a dense channel spacing of 1.6 nm and a minimum insertion loss of 6.1 dB. The wavelength tuning efficiency is measured to be 6.4 nm/W.},

Here, we show how the best approximation obtained for a given loss depends on the filter complexity, the total number of arms, and the specified tolerance to fabrication errors. We derive explicity the minimum loss required to produce a given approximation, and show that the filter design is primarily determined by two parameters, the ratio of channel spacing to passband width and the passband flatness. We determine explicitly the optimum design conditions. We show that the loss can be entirely eliminated by concatenating two routers, synchronized so as to produce a unitary transformation over a finite passband.},

Therefore, there is a high crosstalk in conventional N \&\#x00D7; N silicon AWG, which is very detrimental for router applications. In order to address it, a simple design with a constant projected period on a line tangent to the grating at its pole for the array waveguides near the FPR is proposed, and aberrations of all output wavelengths within a FSR are kept at a rather low level both for the center and edge input. Then we fabricate two kinds of AWG routers with the conventional and proposed design respectively on a SOI wafer, and experimental results show that spectral responses of the AWG router with the proposed design are significantly improved compared to those obtained in the conventional design, especially for the edge channel input.},

    abstract={Segmenting silicon waveguides at the subwavelength scale produce an equivalent homogenous material. The geometry of the waveguide segments provides precise control over modal confinement, effective index, dispersion and birefringence, thereby opening up new approaches to design devices with unprecedented performance. Indeed, with ever-improving lithographic technologies offering sub-100-nm patterning resolution in the silicon photonics platform, many practical devices based on subwavelength structures have been demonstrated in recent years. Subwavelength engineering has thus become an integral design tool in silicon photonics, and both fundamental understanding and novel applications are advancing rapidly. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art in this field. We first cover the basics of subwavelength structures, and discuss substrate leakage, fabrication jitter, reduced backscatter, and engineering of material anisotropy. We then review recent applications including broadband waveguide couplers, high-sensitivity evanescent field sensors, low-loss devices for mid-infrared photonics, polarization management structures, spectral filters, and highly efficient fiber-to-chip couplers. We finally discuss the future prospects for subwavelength silicon structures and their impact on advanced device design.},

    igabstract = {In this paper we present a full-vectorial finite-difference analysis of microstructured optical fibers. A new mode solver is described which uses Yee's 2-D mesh and an index averaging technique. The modal characteristics are calculated for both conventional optical fibers and microstructured optical fibers. Comparison with previous finite difference mode solvers and other numerical methods is made and excellent agreement is achieved.},

    abstract = {Summary This chapter talks about three-dimensional FDTD simulation. In actuality, three-dimensional FDTD simulation is very much like two-dimensional simulation—only harder. It is harder because of logistical problems: we use all vector fields and each one is in three dimensions. The chapter first discusses free space simulation, and then explains the perfectly matched layer (PML) for three dimensions and total/scattered field formulation in three dimensions. It presents a program that generates a plane wave in three dimensions. Specifying a sphere in three dimensions is similar to specifying a cylinder in two dimensions. The major difference is that it must be done for all three electric fields. Controlled Vocabulary Terms finite difference time-domain analysis}

    abstract = {We investigate the reduction of transition loss across the star coupler boundary in a silicon arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) by suppressing multimode generation and scattering near the boundary of a star coupler. Eight-channel silicon AWGs were designed with optimal conditions based on enhanced field matching in combination with ultrashallow etched structures. The fabricated AWG demonstrates an insertion loss down to 0.63 dB with a cross talk of {\textminus}23 to {\textminus}25.3  dB, exhibiting $\sim$0.8  dB improvement of insertion loss and $\sim$4  dB improvement of cross talk compared to the Si AWG fabricated with a conventional double-etch technique.},
