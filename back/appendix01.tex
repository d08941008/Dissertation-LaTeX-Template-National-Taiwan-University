\appendix{A}{Phase correction for RSoft simulation model}
\section{Introduction}
    Given that the BPM provided by RSoft is utilized with non-rotatable field monitor, 
    a phase-correction step should be involved between two FPRs simulations. 
    The default executable program ``phasecor.exe'' offered by RSoft was replaced with 
    a user-defined python function, 
    considering the wider mode was employed in the AWG to reduce the side-wall roughness. 
    Detailed contents of the python file as well as the mastering callers are provided in the following sections.
