\section{Introduction}
    To find the extremum of a figure of merit function more efficiently, 
    an user-defined Lumerical functional script was employed during the optimization of the 
    broadband asymmetric directional coupler with the aim of dropping signal. 
    To meet the Lumerical optmization configuration, 
    three separate scripts named ``APSO\_first.lsf'', ``APSO\_next.lsf'', and ``UDA\_fom'' were developed 
    for ``first generation'', ``next generation'', and ``fom function'' of the optimization.
